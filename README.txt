Vanadium, n: metallic element used to strengthen steel alloys
=============================================================

Like a wrench from your toolbox, a conventional browser's UI is
basically made from two parts: the web page they're displaying (the
steel) and the UI around that (the chrome coating) to make it look
shiny.  Thing is, good tools are made not from steel alone but from a
stronger alloy, created by adding vanadium to the steel.

This extension improves the Firefox UI in a similar way by blending
some of the web app's UI into the Firefox UI, thereby adding an extra
element to the steel and chrome mix.
