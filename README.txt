Vanadium, n: metallic element used to strengthen steel alloys
=============================================================

Like a wrench from your toolbox, a browser UI basically is made from
two parts: the web page they're displaying (the steel) and the UI
around that (the chrome coating) to make it look shiny.  Thing is,
good tools are made not from steel alone but from a stronger alloy of
steel and vanadium.

This extension improves the Firefox UI in a similar way by blending
some of the web app's UI into the Firefox UI, thereby adding an extra
element to the steel and chrome mix.
